	write_idblock_blxs2xx.c

	Example of using WriteIdBlock.lib and one of WriteIdBlock_RCM43xx.LIB,
	WriteIdBlock_RCM40xx.LIB, WriteIdBlock_RCM54xxW.LIB, or
	WriteIdBlock_RCM45xxW.LIB to write a system ID Block to an appropriate Rabbit
	4000+ based core module, for use as a BLxS2xx SBC topping.

	The core module must be one of the following types:
	   An RCM4310  paired with BLxS2xx SBC board == BL4S200.
	   An RCM4010  paired with BLxS2xx SBC board == BL4S210.
	   An RCM5400W paired with BLxS2xx SBC board == BL5S220.
	   An RCM4510W paired with BLxS2xx SBC board == BL4S230.

	Special note for the BL5S220 (RCM5400W core module):
	   Each RCM5400W core module's WiFi is individually calibrated. The WiFi
	   calibration information is stored in the system constants table, which
	   should never be erased. The size of the system constants table is
	   determined by the value of the _DC_CONST_SZ_ system macro, which should
	   always equal 128. This system ID block writing utility makes every effort
	   to preserve the content of the system constants area, even on boards which
	   no longer have a valid system ID block.

	To program a BLxS2xx core module which lacks an existing correct and valid
	system ID block, add the appropriate set of the following sets of macro=value
	lines to Dynamic C's Project Options' Defines tab. If Dynamic C stops the
	compile because of too many invalid macro redefinition warnings, increase the
	"Max Shown > Warnings:" count to 100 on the Project Options' Compiler tab.

	Instruction for the BL4S200 (RCM4310 core module), BL4S210 (RCM4010 core
	module), or BL5S220 (RCM5400W core module) only:
	   If the board does not already have a system ID block with a unique MAC
	   address then edit the const char newMAC[6] array below and press the N key
	   when asked, "Retain the XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX MAC address (Y/N)?"

	Instruction for the BL4S230 (RCM4510W core module) only:
	   To add a _DC_XBEE_ID_ system macro uncomment the XBEE_ID_VALUE macro
	   definition line, below. To have the program set the _DC_XBEE_ID_ system
	   macro based on the installed XBee module, define the XBEE_ID_VALUE macro's
	   value to 0xFFFFFFFFul. To skip XBee version detection, either define the
	   XBEE_ID_VALUE macro's value to 0 (no XBee installed) or define the
	   XBEE_ID_VALUE macro to a known valid value constructed according to the
	   following information:
	      Upper 16 bits -- hardware version
	         0x1941 - XBee Series 2 (ember processor, ZNet 2.5 or ZB firmware)
	      Lower 16 bits -- firmware version
	         0x1141 - ZNet coordinator firmware
	         0x1341 - ZNet router/end device firmware
	         0x2121 - ZB coordinator firmware
	         0x2321 - ZB router firmware
	         0x2921 - ZB end device firmware
	   For example, if using a known XBee series 2 module with firmware version
	   0x2921, set xbee_id = 0x19412921ul. Note that this setting is only
	   effective when using Dynamic C version 10.44 or later.

	If rewriting the system ID block in order to change the size of the User
	block or the size of the system's persistent data area, the following
	information should be of particular interest.

	The MAX_USERBLOCK_SIZE macro value tells Dynamic C how much flash storage
	space is reserved for the Rabbit board's system ID and User blocks area, as
	described in the following paragraphs. On all parallel flash equipped and on
	some serial boot flash equipped Rabbit boards, this reserved area size is
	excluded from the xmem code memory org in order to prevent overwrite of the
	system ID and User blocks reserved area. On Rabbit boards equipped with small
	sector flash devices, the value of the MAX_USERBLOCK_SIZE macro should be at
	least ((WIB_SYS4KBLKS + WIB_USER4KBLKS * 2ul) * 4096ul). Large or nonuniform
	sector flash devices' sector layout may cause "gaps" between the system ID
	block and / or the User block images, requiring a further increase in the
	MAX_USERBLOCK_SIZE macro's value. In this latter case, a run time exception
	assertion failure may occur in the WriteIdBlock.lib library. To see more
	information about such an exception, define WIB_VERBOSE (see code below),
	recompile and rerun this utility program. Also see the flash device's data
	sheet to find its sector layout, which in turn determines the optimal
	MAX_USERBLOCK_SIZE macro value.

	All stock Rabbit 4000+ based boards have an 8 KByte (less 6 bytes for the
	validity marker) User block installed. A nonstandard User block size is
	possible within the restrictions imposed by the program (primary, parallel
	or serial) flash type. The User assumes all responsibility for any problems
	that may result from making such a change. In all cases the User block size,
	combined with the 6 byte validity marker, must be in the range [0,64] KBytes
	(i.e. in the range [0,16] 4K blocks). Uncomment and edit the WIB_USER4KBLKS
	macro definition below to set a nonstandard User block size.

	On all stock Rabbit 4000+ based boards the system ID block is combined with a
	persistent data area (16 KBytes in total) which contains the system macros
	table and, optionally, extra memory devices specification table, persistent
	constants, etc. The information in the persistent data area may be extremely
	difficult for a User to replace correctly, and is not intended for alteration
	by User code. A nonstandard persistent data area size is possible on some
	boards depending on the program (primary, parallel or serial) flash type. The
	User assumes all responsibility for any problems that may result from making
	such a change. In all cases the minimum persistent data area size, combined
	with the system ID block, is 4 KBytes (i.e. one 4K block). Uncomment and edit
	the WIB_SYS4KBLKS macro definition below to set a nonstandard persistent data
	area size.
