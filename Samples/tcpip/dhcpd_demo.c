   DHCP Server Demo

   IMPORTANT: Before connecting Rabbit to the network and running this sample
              program, ensure that no DHCP server already exists on the network.

   This sample demonstrates the simple DHCP server functionality provided in
   dhcpd.lib. An Ethernet-equipped or WiFi-equipped Rabbit board can provide an
   IP address, a netmask and (optionally) router and DNS addresses for client
   hosts in a LAN subnet.

   A selection of DHCP client pool sizes are possible, one of 1, 5, 13, 29, 61,
   125 or 253 client hosts (i.e. 2**n - 3 clients, where n is in 2,3,4,...,8).

   Optionally, defining DHCPD_GATEWAY and nonzero DHCPD_DNS_PRIMARY or
   DHCPD_DNS_SECONDARY allows Rabbit and its DHCP clients to communicate with
   devices whose IP address is outside of Rabbit's LAN subnet. See the commented
   out example DHCP_GATEWAY definition in this sample for more information.

   Please refer to comments near the top of dhcpd.lib for more complete details
   of Rabbit's simple DHCP server operation.

   Minimal example instructions, using an Ethernet-equipped Rabbit board and a
   Windows PC that has Dynamic C installed:
      1. Ensure that your PC is not set up to be a DHCP server. Refer to your
         PC's manual for the required procedure. Note that PCs are almost never
         configured to be a DHCP server.
      2. Connect the Rabbit's Ethernet port directly to your PC's Ethernet port,
         using either a crossover or straight through Ethernet cable as
         appropriate for your Rabbit board and PC. If unsure which type of
         Ethernet cable to use, an auto-MDIX hub or switch can be connected
         between the Rabbit and PC, using two Ethernet cables in any combination
         of crossover or straight through types.
      3. Power up the Rabbit and the PC.
      4. Configure your PC to be a DHCP client. Refer to your PC's manual for
         the required procedure. Ensure that your PC is not configured with a
         static IP, not even as an alternate configuration.
      5. Using Dynamic C in debug mode, compile and run this (unaltered) sample
         program on your Rabbit board.
      6. Observe Dynamic C's STDIO window to see Rabbit's DHCP server IP, subnet
         mask and DHCP pool address range information.
      7. With Dynamic C's STDIO window in focus, periodically press the PC's D
         key to dump DHCP lease information. After a few moments you should see
         a DHCP lease entry listed.
      8. Compare your PC's network settings with the information listed in
         Rabbit's DHCP lease table; the information should match.

   More elaborate example instructions, using a router, an Ethernet-equipped or
   WiFi-equipped Rabbit board and a Windows PC that has Dynamic C installed:
      1. If your PC is Ethernet-equipped, connect your PC's Ethernet port to a
         LAN-side Ethernet port on your router using a straight through Ethernet
         cable.
      2. If your Rabbit board is Ethernet-equipped, connect the Rabbit's
         Ethernet port to a LAN-side Ethernet port on your router using a
         straight through Ethernet cable.
      3. Power up your Rabbit board, PC and router.
      4. Configure your router to have, on its LAN side, static IP address
         192.168.20.1 and net mask 255.255.255.0. Refer to your router's manual
         for the required procedure.
      5. Temporarily configure your PC to have static IP address 192.168.20.200
         and net mask 255.255.255.0. Refer to your PC's manual for the required
         procedure. Note that this static IP address is chosen because it is
         outside of the range of DHCP client addresses to be served by Rabbit.
      6. Ensure that the LAN side of your router has no DHCP server. In many
         cases, this requires disabling of the router's built-in DHCP server.
         Refer to your router's manual for the required procedure.
      7. If your router has WiFi B/G capability and your Rabbit board is WiFi-
         equipped, edit the WiFi custom configuration section's IFC_WIFI_.*
         macro definitions, below, to suit your wireless network. Refer to your
         router's manual for the procedure to obtain the required information.
      8. Uncomment the commented-out DHCPD_GATEWAY macro definition line, below.
      9. Edit the PERMANENT_LEASE_MAC_ADDRESS macro value string, in the "#ifdef
         DHCPD_GATEWAY" conditional code section below, to suit your router's
         LAN-side MAC address. Refer to your router's manual for the procedure
         to obtain the required MAC address information.
      10 Using Dynamic C in debug mode, compile and run this (unaltered, except
         as described above) sample program on your Rabbit board.
      11 Configure your PC to be a DHCP client. Refer to your PC's manual for
         the required procedure. Ensure that your PC is not configured with a
         static IP, not even as an alternate configuration.
      12 Observe Dynamic C's STDIO window to see Rabbit's DHCP server IP, subnet
         mask and DHCP pool address range information.
      13 With Dynamic C's STDIO window in focus, periodically press the PC's D
         key to dump DHCP lease information. After a few moments you should see
         the PC's DHCP lease entry listed in addition to the router's permanent
         entry.
      14 Compare your PC's network settings with the information listed in
         Rabbit's DHCP lease table; the information should match.
