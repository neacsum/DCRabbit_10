/*******************************************************************************
        Samples\tcpip\POP3\pop_tls.c

        A program that will connect to a POP3 server and download
        e-mail from it, optionally deleting the messages after they have
        been read. This version extends the "parse_extend.c" sample to
        add TLS security.



        WARNING: This sample suggests use of some freely available POP3
        services (GMail and Hotmail).  This is for purpose of demonstration
        only and does not imply that use of those services for anything other
        than test/development is permitted by those service providers.
        Please read and abide by the provider's relevant service agreements.


        Before running:

        *  Make sure your basic network configuration is OK, including a
           DNS (name server) and a route to the outside Internet.  The
           default in this sample expects DHCP.  You can use a different
           TCPCONFIG macro and set alternative parameters if necessary.
           (If necessary, use a simpler sample to get this working).
        *  Set up a Google Gmail account for test purposes.  Follow Google's
           instructions for "enabling POP" on this account.
           See http://gmail.com.
        *  You'll also need to turn on access for "Less secure apps".  As of
           March 2017, you can do so at:
             https://www.google.com/settings/u/1/security/lesssecureapps
        *  Modify the POP_USER and POP_PASS macros to be the account name and
           password that you used in step (2).  It is most convenient to
           put these in the Options->ProjectOptions->Defines panel e.g.
              POP_USER="my_account@gmail.com"
              POP_PASS="myPassw0rd"
        *  The POP_SERVER and POP_PORT macros are set appropriately for
           Gmail as of the time this sample was constructed, but you may wish
           to check this if the sample seems to fail in spite of everything.
           You can override these macros in the Defines panel.
        *  For Hotmail/Outlook.com, #define USE_OUTLOOK_SETTINGS, and use your
           Hotmail/Outlook.com credentials in POP_USER and POP_PASS.  You may
           also need to enable POP access for your account in Options:
              https://outlook.live.com/owa/#path=/options/popandimap
        
        To date, Yahoo does not allow POP3/SMTP access with their free email
        accounts.
